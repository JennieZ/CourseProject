Below is the list of features in the result tidy data set. 

Subject is the the id of the volunteer who participated in this experiment. Activity indicates the activity performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).


Refer to features_info.txt in the original data package for more information of the measurements. **Note that the result tidy data averages each measurement for each activity and each subject.**
